3. # Description of my porfolio:
   
  * Purpose: 
        Porfolio was made with 4 main content: 
  
            - Home page : Include with Github , Linkdin and Twitter link to those main page. It also has the VP logo on the left hand side and a Menu bar on the left side leading you to all those pages. 
            - About page : There is some information about myself, what my interest is and what skills i got so far since i code.
            - Project page : There are 2 projects so far which i worked on and link lead to Github repo to those project. A link to a future project will be added in Github repo .
            - Blog page: 5 example blogs added but no content yet. 

        My porfolio was made for the learning purpose and understanding the concept of HTML and CSS. I had so much fun explore different styling which Css provide and it is an endless list. I think my porfolio could be better overtime but for the moment this porfolio was a hard working provement and sucessful deploy.
